Assignment 1 - Soybean Analysis

Project Title DAI Assignment 1 - Soybean Yield Analysis

Author 23112045 - Jay Jain

Project Overview This project focuses on analyzing soybean yield by examining agricultural data. The project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data to draw meaningful conclusions regarding soybean production patterns.

Objectives:

Clean the raw dataset for analysis.
Perform univariate and bivariate analysis.
Group the data into relevant columns for better insights.
Analyze the key factors contributing to soybean yield variations.
Draw conclusions based on the analysis.

Workflow

Data Cleaning Handled missing or inconsistent values in the dataset. Removed irrelevant columns that don't contribute to the analysis.
Data Grouping Grouped soybean crops based on soil type, climate conditions, and fertilizer usage.
Univariate Analysis Analyzed individual columns (e.g., soil pH, rainfall levels) to understand distributions.
Bivariate Analysis Performed analysis between different pairs of columns to understand relationships (e.g., fertilizer usage vs. yield, rainfall vs. soil pH).
Conclusion Summarized findings from the analysis, highlighting the key factors influencing soybean yield.

Technologies Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) Jupyter Notebook

Conclusion

Based on the analysis, several factors such as soil composition, rainfall, and fertilizer usage were found to significantly impact soybean yield. These insights can help farmers optimize their agricultural practices for better crop production.
