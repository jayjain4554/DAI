### **Project Title:**
DAI Assignment 1 - Churn Rate Analysis

### **Author:**

### **Project Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing the churn rate of a company by examining customer data. The analysis involves data cleaning, detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization using interactive plots, and statistical testing to draw meaningful conclusions regarding customer retention patterns.

### **Objectives:**
- Clean the raw dataset for analysis.
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis.
- Group the data into relevant columns for better insights.
- Analyze key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Use various visualization techniques including line plots, bar graphs, bubble plots, violin plots, and heatmaps.
- Perform statistical tests such as ANOVA to derive insights.
- Draw conclusions based on the analysis.

### **Workflow:**

#### **Data Cleaning:**
- Handled missing or inconsistent values in the dataset.
- Removed irrelevant columns that don't contribute to the analysis.

#### **Data Grouping:**
- Grouped customers based on their tenure and payment methods.

#### **Univariate Analysis:**
- Analyzed individual columns (e.g., tenure, payment methods) to understand distributions.
- Generated histograms, boxplots, and violin plots to visualize data distributions.

#### **Bivariate Analysis:**
- Performed correlation heatmaps, scatterplots, and pairplots.
- Analyzed relationships between key variables (e.g., payment method vs. churn rate, tenure vs. churn).
- Created interactive bubble plots using Plotly for deeper insights.

#### **Statistical Analysis:**
- Performed ANOVA to determine whether categorical variables significantly impact numerical variables.

#### **Conclusion:**
- Summarized findings from the analysis, highlighting the key factors influencing customer churn.
- Based on the analysis, several factors such as payment methods, tenure, and internet service usage were found to significantly impact the churn rate.
- These insights can help the company improve its customer retention strategies by targeting high-risk churn groups with better engagement and support services.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scipy
- **Jupyter Notebook**
